# Deep AutoVIML
### There different use-cases have been explored in this assignment
#### The first one is Meta learning from the keras guides using the reptile algorithm
#### The second one is MMoE Multi-task learning model using the census income dataset
#### The third one is a hello world using continual learning with the avalanche library and omniglot dataset
