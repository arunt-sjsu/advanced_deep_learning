## Multi-Task Learning for Dense Prediction Tasks: A Perspective
Multi-task learning is a family of deep learning techniques to learn a generalized scheme of tasks rather than learning a single task. Dense prediction is getting a dense output for images/videos at a pixel level. The idea is to learn multiple tasks through a common shared representation. 

The article focus on the different multi-task learning techniques, how to attack common issues and different optimization techniques. The article is based on a survey paper  titled Multi-Task Learning for Dense Prediction Tasks: A Survey (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13379.pdf)
